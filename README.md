## 👨‍💻 Hi, I’m @hamzakhalid34

I’m a **Software Development Engineer** with expertise in a range of technologies. I specialize in **Python** and **FastAPI** for backend development, building efficient and scalable systems. I also work with **Generative AI (GenAI)** and **Realtime APIs** to create intelligent, responsive applications. My experience extends to **application development**, where I contribute both to **full-stack projects** and **backend solutions**. I have a strong background in **databases**, including design, integration, and management. Additionally, I’m skilled in **C++** and **Qt**, focusing on performance-critical applications. While my primary focus is **backend development**, I also contribute to **frontend projects** to ensure smooth, integrated user experiences.
